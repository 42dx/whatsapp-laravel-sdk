# Whatsapp Laravel SDK

This Laravel package's goal is to abstract and simplify the integration with the Facebook's Whatsapp Business API through services, facades and methods, as well properly documenting how to work with it, since it is sometimes hard to find the info you need to correctly implement the API.

## Tooling

There are a few tools we provide alongside with the source code to ease a little bit the burden of following a bunch of patterns and standards we set up, as well as automate some boring processes.

- `comitizen`: This CLI helps with writting commit messages in a meaningful and standardized way, so that our automation process can use them to properly write our software, changelog. To use it, you just need to run `composer commit` from the repository's root folder instead of the traditional `git commit` and follow the cli interactive steps :)

## Contributors

Kudos to all our dear contributors. Without them, nothing would have been possible :heart:
